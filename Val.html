    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day My Love ❤️</h1>
    <p>
    You are the most amazing person in my life.
    Thank you for loving me, supporting me, and making me smile every day.
    Happy Valentine's Day to the one who feels closest to my heart, even when MILES stands between us.
    Loving you from a distance isn't easy. There are days I wish I could reach into my phone and pull you into my arms, days I wish time zones didn't exist and goodbyes didn't hurt this much. But even with all of that, I would still choose you OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
    <br><br>
    Some nights, I miss you so deeply it feels physical. I miss your voice when I need comfort, your presence when the world feels too loud, the way being near you makes everything feel okay.
    It hurts not being able to touch you, not being able to look into your eyes and tell you how much you mean to me. But somehow, even from far away, you still manage to make me feel loved.
    <br><br>
    Distance has taught me how strong love can be. It has taught me patience, faith and trust. It has shown me that real love isn't convenience- it's about commitment. And despite the miles, the waiting and the tears, my heart has never been unsure of you.
    When I miss you, I imagine the day we won't have to count the days anymore. The day our goodbyes turn into "I AM AT YOUR DOOR"!!!
    <br><br>
    Thank you for choosing me every day, even when it's hard. Thank you for loving me from afar, for reassuring me, for staying, and for believing in us. Please know that there is someone here who loves you deeply, prays for you constantly, and carries you in their heart in everything they do.
    This distance may test us, but will never break us. Because what we have is real (I should think so😆) and real love always finds its way back home.
    Until I can hold you close, please remember this: NO MATTER HOW FAR APART WE ARE, my heart is always with you.
    Forever yours… Always waiting… Always Loving

    I am so lucky to call you mine 💕
